# CryptoCurrency-Investigation-Toolkit
The goal of the project is to create a tool that can differentiate between multiple different crypto currencies.
Different cryptocurrencies runs their own variant of the Cryptographic hashing algorithm that are used to generate 
keys/addresses for a particular cryptocurrency. 
We aim to collect these set of possible addresses and keys for different cryptocurrencies and run an analysis on them and then 
write a Machine Learning algorithm which can predict the cryptocurrency given the keys/addresses

The technologies that will be used for this study are:
Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib , pickle and Scikit-learn
Wallet Scripts : Ether, Doge, Bitcoin and Litecoin. 
Asymmetric Cryptographic Algorithms: ECDSA,Variants of ECDSA , etc..,
Local Deployment : Stream-lit
